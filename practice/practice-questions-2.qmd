### Question 5
You have a dataset with 10,000 labeled images for training a CNN. To prevent overfitting, which technique should you consider implementing?

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>
Dropout is a regularization technique that helps prevent overfitting by randomly setting some neurons to zero during training.

### Question 8
You have a model that predicts whether a customer will make a purchase. You notice a high rate of false negatives. Which metric should you focus on improving?

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>
Recall is the metric that reflects the ability to identify all actual positives, which is crucial when reducing false negatives.

### Question 10
You're using transfer learning to fine-tune a pre-trained BERT model for a custom NLP task. What is the most important hyperparameter to adjust during fine-tuning?

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>
Learning rate is crucial in fine-tuning because a lower rate ensures that the pre-trained weights are adjusted carefully.
