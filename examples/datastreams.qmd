# Introduction

This document compares AWS streaming solutions: **Kinesis Data Streams**, **Kinesis Data Firehose**, **Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (MSK)**, and **Amazon Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow (AMAA)**. We'll explore their use cases, differences, and provide code examples.

# Overview of Services

## Kinesis Data Streams
AWS **Kinesis Data Streams** is a real-time streaming service for collecting, processing, and analyzing large volumes of data. It provides low-latency access and supports custom consumer applications.

### Key Features:
- Real-time data processing
- Custom applications using AWS SDKs
- Retention period up to 7 days

### Sample Code: Writing to Kinesis Data Stream

```python
import boto3
import json

def put_record_to_kinesis(stream_name, data):
    kinesis_client = boto3.client('kinesis')
    response = kinesis_client.put_record(
        StreamName=stream_name,
        Data=json.dumps(data),
        PartitionKey="partition-1"
    )
    return response

# Example usage
record = {"event": "click", "user": "12345"}
put_record_to_kinesis("my-stream", record)
```

## Kinesis Data Firehose
AWS **Kinesis Data Firehose** is a managed service that loads streaming data into data lakes, warehouses, or analytics services. Unlike Data Streams, Firehose handles buffering and batch writing.

### Key Features:
- Fully managed with automatic scaling
- Supports S3, Redshift, Elasticsearch, and Splunk as destinations
- No custom consumer applications required

### Sample Code: Writing to Firehose

```python
import boto3
import json

def put_record_to_firehose(delivery_stream_name, data):
    firehose_client = boto3.client('firehose')
    response = firehose_client.put_record(
        DeliveryStreamName=delivery_stream_name,
        Record={"Data": json.dumps(data) + "\n"}
    )
    return response

# Example usage
record = {"event": "purchase", "amount": 100}
put_record_to_firehose("my-firehose-stream", record)
```

## Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (MSK)
MSK provides a **fully managed Kafka cluster** that integrates with AWS services. Itâ€™s ideal for applications needing open-source Kafka features.

### Key Features:
- Fully managed Kafka clusters
- Secure with IAM authentication
- Supports standard Kafka clients

### Sample Code: Producing Messages to Kafka

```python
from kafka import KafkaProducer
import json

producer = KafkaProducer(
    bootstrap_servers=['b-1.msk-cluster.amazonaws.com:9092'],
    value_serializer=lambda v: json.dumps(v).encode('utf-8')
)

producer.send("my-topic", {"event": "login", "user": "user_123"})
producer.flush()
```

## Amazon Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow (AMAA)
AMAA is a managed **workflow orchestration service** based on Apache Airflow. Unlike real-time streaming services, it is used for **data pipeline scheduling and orchestration**.

### Key Features:
- Fully managed Airflow environment
- DAG-based workflow scheduling
- Integrates with AWS services

### Sample Code: Defining an Airflow DAG in AMAA

```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.dummy import DummyOperator
from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
from datetime import datetime

def my_task():
    print("Running my task")

default_args = {"start_date": datetime(2024, 2, 1)}

dag = DAG("my_dag", default_args=default_args, schedule_interval="@daily")

start = DummyOperator(task_id="start", dag=dag)
task = PythonOperator(task_id="run_task", python_callable=my_task, dag=dag)

start >> task
```

# Conclusion

Each AWS streaming service serves a different purpose:
- **Kinesis Data Streams**: Real-time custom streaming apps
- **Kinesis Firehose**: Managed ETL to AWS data stores
- **MSK**: Open-source Kafka for event-driven architectures
- **AMAA**: Workflow automation with Airflow

Choose the right service based on your use case!
